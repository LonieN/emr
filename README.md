# emr
A blockchain-based electronic medical record storage records and sharing system.

The system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric and Node.js. Currently there are four web interfaces for admin, patient, doctor and labratory. The admin registers users to the system. A patient can view his/her EMR data and also manage access of doctor and labratory technician to add/view his/her EMR data. A doctor can add/view EMR data of a patient upon authorization by a patient. A lab-technician can add patient labratory test data upon authorization by a patient.
